<h2 id="notes-to-demonstrators">Notes to demonstrators</h2>
<p>Our role here is to empower the students so they: * feel confident messing around in the commandline * can be confident that what they did is correct.</p>
<p>So we do not just want to give them answers. When you're talking to a student, <em>force</em> them to think. For example, if they ask a question, answer with a simpler question that helps to decompose the problem. Iterate as necessary.And/or check their skills - have they completely understood how to do the simple stuff? Encourage them to try things that will fail. Encourage them to decipher R's cryptic error messages - there is actually real information in them. Have <em>them</em> type; not you.</p>
<p>When we are in the room we should be constantly talking to students. Don't wait for questions - many students are too shy/embarrassed to ask them and will be grateful if you come up to them.</p>
<p>If you see a student doing things badly (e.g. copying R-code from Word; not using the built-in R text editor; not indenting thigns; not using human-friendly variable names), make it clear that there are better ways that will make it easier for you &amp; them to write/read/understand/learn/be productive.</p>
<p>Work through the relevant material in preparation for a team meeting 1 week before the practical. Please edit the document to improve it! If you'd like to discuss a point or give a suggestion, you can email the group. The meeting will be an additional opportunity to clarify if/what needs to be revised/improved, or what the different possible approaches are for a given exercise (and their advantages/disadvantages).</p>
<h3 id="lead-ta">Lead TA</h3>
<p>For each practical is in charge of revising the content &amp; making sure that everything works. Note that the content from last year has potential - it can and should be improved where possible/necessary. (Implementing improvements adds extra hours to what you'll have contributed for this course).</p>
<ul>
<li>it is your responsibility to ensure that a meeting takes place 1 week before (I suggest Wednedsday 1 week before the practical at 1pm, but this is up to you to decide). Send your team an email reminding them of this at least 2 weeks before the practical.</li>
<li>you can make executive decisions regarding what will stay or go in the practical overview text. There is complete flexibility with this. The wording/structure can be completely changed.</li>
<li>On day of practical, you'll write the short url on the board (or projector) for the students, and tell them to get started etc, make any general announcements as needed etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additionally">Additionally:</h3>
<ul>
<li>ensure that you know how to do this stuff.</li>
<li>undergraduates should have done http://goo.gl/qsjJs5 before the first practical - you should be on top of all basic R handling too.</li>
<li>The practicals are not necessarily easy/intuitive.</li>
<li>you should have worked through your practical at least 1 week beforehand. Where you struggled is likely where students will also struggle.</li>
<li>you guys can help each other out</li>
<li>We are using the <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html">Hadley Wickham style guide</a></li>
<li>For many exercises there are multiple possible solutions. That's cool. Some may be easier, some may suck.</li>
<li>You are welcome (but by no means obliged!) to attend the lectures where we'll be going over the basics.</li>
<li>The practicals as we have them are imperfect. Don't hesitate to suggest changes.</li>
<li>In &quot;light orange&quot; are commenting links - you can make comments there; or liaise directly with the practical leader with regards to specific suggestions. These can include structure, wording, deleting/adding sections.</li>
