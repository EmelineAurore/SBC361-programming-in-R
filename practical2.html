<h1 id="computing-in-r---practical-2">Computing in R - Practical 2</h1>
<p>SBC361: Research Methods and Communication</p>
<p>October 2015</p>
<p>In this session we will build on some of the skills learned in the previous practical, and will move on to consider some more advanced ways of controlling program flow. Today we will be exploring loops and functions, two important features of R that are also present in most programming languages, as well as doing a few exercises with DNA/RNA strings. As before, you will want to refer frequently to the help files and your own notes when exploring these new concepts.</p>
<p>To get your brains warmed up, here a a few questions on the material from last week:</p>
<h4 id="intro-q1.-what-would-be-the-outcome-of-the-code-my.matrix-diag5-then-what-would-be-the-outcome-of-the-code-colsumsmy.matrix">Intro Q1. What would be the outcome of the code my.matrix&lt;-diag(5)? Then what would be the outcome of the code colSums(my.matrix)?</h4>

Load the data Indometh. Subset this data to return only those fields for which the concentration is between 1 and 2? What is the average (mean) growth rate for this subset?</h4>
<h4 id="intro-q3.-what-is-the-regular-expression-code-that-corresponds-to-one-or-more-copies-of-the-letter-e-followed-by-one-or-more-copies-of-the-letter-z">Intro Q3. What is the regular expression code that corresponds to one or more copies of the letter &quot;e&quot;, followed by one or more copies of the letter &quot;z&quot;?</h4>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Functions are pieces of code that are made to take an input (generally known as arguments), do something with it, and give back an output. They are interesting because they allow you to run the same piece of code multiple times without having to write it entirely every time you need to run it.</p>
<p>To take a self-explanatory example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x      &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>)
x.mean &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mean</span>(x)</code></pre>
<p>We just used the <code>mean()</code> function, one of many functions loaded by default in R. The point of this function is that you can calculate the mean of any vector without explicitly writing the formula for the mean each time. The interesting thing about R is that it is possible to create your own functions. Let's create our own function to calculate the mean:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Define function named myMean

myMean &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(my.vector) {
  ## Calculate the mean
  my.mean &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">sum</span>(my.vector)/<span class="kw">length</span>(my.vector)

  ## Return the calculated mean
  <span class="kw">return</span>(my.mean)
}

## Now call the function on some data:
x      &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>)
x.mean &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">myMean</span>(x)</code></pre>
<p>The syntax <code>functionName &lt;- function(parameter) {code}</code> is the most common way of defining a function. Remember to add the <code>return()</code> bit, otherwise the function will compute the code but it won't return anything!</p>
<p>Now take a look at the following code. This code is designed to take a number in seconds, and convert it into hours, minutes and remaining seconds (don't worry too much about the computation in the middle):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># Input raw number of seconds</span>
number.of.seconds &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">19955</span>

<span class="co"># Convert number.of.seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds</span>
hours |<span class="st">  </span><span class="er">|</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="er">&lt;</span>-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">floor</span>(number.of.seconds /(<span class="dv">60</span>*<span class="dv">60</span>))
minutes |<span class="st"> </span><span class="er">&lt;</span>-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">floor</span>((number.of.seconds -hours*(<span class="dv">60</span>*<span class="dv">60</span>))/<span class="dv">60</span>)
seconds |<span class="st"> </span><span class="er">&lt;</span>-<span class="st"> </span>number.of.seconds -((hours*<span class="dv">60</span>)+minutes)*<span class="dv">60</span>

<span class="co"># Create a single vector containing all three quantities</span>
outputvec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(hours, minutes, seconds)

<span class="co"># Output the solution to the console</span>
outputvec</code></pre>

<h3 id="more-complex-functions">More complex functions</h3>
<p>Hopefully you can already see how functions can be very useful things. We can make them even more useful by considering some simple extensions.</p>
<p>First, you can define multiple arguments to a function, with the general syntax of a function being:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">my_function &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(argument1, argument2, ...) {
    <span class="co">#code including argument1, argument2, ...</span>
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="q3.-to-understand-how-a-function-can-have-multiple-arguments-modify-the-function-timeconverter-so-that-adds-a-given-number-of-hours-to-the-result.-you-will-have-to-include-a-new-parameter-you-can-call-it-additional.hours-and-add-it-to-the-hours-variable.">Q3. To understand how a function can have multiple arguments, modify the function <code>timeConverter()</code> so that adds a given number of hours to the result. You will have to include a new parameter (you can call it <code>additional.hours</code>), and add it to the <code>hours</code> variable.</h4>
<p>Note that functions do not have to take single numbers as input. They can take vectors, matrices, data frames, or any other type of object, and they can also take character and logical data as well as numerical.</p>
<h4 id="q4.-make-a-function-takes-a-vector-of-words-as-input-and-outputs-the-number-of-characters-in-the-longest-word.-hint-you-are-going-to-need-to-find-out-how-r-counts-the-number-of-characters-in-words-and-how-it-finds-the-maximum-value-in-a-vector---use-google">Q4. Make a function takes a vector of words as input, and outputs the number of characters in the longest word. Hint: you are going to need to find out how R counts the number of characters in words and how it finds the maximum value in a vector - use Google!</h4>
<h4 id="q5.a-extra-arguments">Q5.A Extra arguments:</h4>
<p>Another neat thing that we can do is set default values for our arguments. Have another look at the <code>timeConverter()</code> function you modified in Q9. Most of the time, you will probably want run it with <code>additional.hours</code> being 0. To do this, you can make <code>additional.hours=0</code> as a default. With default valus for arguments,function take the syntax <code>myFunction &lt;- function(argument1, ..., argument2=default) {code including argument1, argument2, ...}</code>. The default argument generally goes in the end of the argument list.</p>
<h4 id="q6.b-make-the-additional.hours-be-defined-as-0-by-default-in-the-timeconverter-function.-run-it-without-defining-additional.hours-and-defining-it-to-different-number-of-seconds.">Q6.B Make the <code>additional.hours</code> be defined as 0 by default in the <code>timeConverter()</code> function. Run it without defining <code>additional.hours</code> and defining it to different number of seconds.</h4>
<h4 id="q7.-this-task-is-a-bit-more-challenging-go-back-to-your-function-for-converting-kilometres-to-miles-make-a-copy-with-an-appropriate-new-name.-the-new-extended-function-you-must-create-should">Q7. This task is a bit more challenging! Go back to your function for converting kilometres to miles; make a copy with an appropriate new name. The new extended function you must create should:</h4>
<ul>
<li>take a distance in kilometres and a time in minutes as input.</li>
<li>convert the distance into miles, and the time into hours. It should then calculate a speed in miles per hour.</li>
<li>return the speed in miles per hour as output.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the skills required to complete this task this are given above. Take your time, and approach this problem one step at a time.</p>
<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
<p>Imagine you need to run the function <code>timeConverter()</code> on different numbers. You could type <code>timeConverter()</code> many different types, each time with a different number. But now imagine you had to type that thousands of times. It would be impossible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, computers were built to perform same task over and over again many times. They do this using a construct called a <em>loop</em>. Although there are several types of loops, we are going to learn about the for loop. It works this way:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## For loop exmaple
for (seconds in <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1000</span>,<span class="dv">2000</span>,<span class="dv">3000</span>,<span class="dv">4000</span>,<span class="dv">5000</span>)) {
  time.in.hours &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">timeConverter</span>(<span class="dt">number.of.seconds=</span>seconds)
  <span class="kw">print</span>(time.in.hours)
}</code></pre>
<p>The loop will run 3 times. Each time, it will define the variable <code>seconds</code> as a different number from the vector <code>(1000,2000,3000)</code>. It will compute a new time in hours and print it.</p>
<h3 id="slightly-more-complex-loops">Slightly more complex loops</h3>
<p>There are some interesting ways in which we can stretch our understanding of loops. First of all, it is important to recognise that the values that we are indexing over can be anything that goes in a vector. The vector can be defined outside the loop definition line:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Non-sequential loop values
seq.values &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">50</span>)
for (i in loop.values) {
  <span class="kw">print</span>(i)
}

## The same as writing:
for (i in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">50</span>) {
  <span class="kw">print</span>(i)
}

## Sequential loop values
loop.values &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">15</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="fl">2.3</span>,<span class="dv">100</span>,<span class="dv">16</span>)
for (index in loop.values) {
 |<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">print</span>(index)
}

## Character based loop values
loop.text &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hey&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Hi&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>)
for (word in loop.text) {
 |<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">print</span>(word)
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="storing-loop-results">Storing loop results</h3>
<p>More often than not, you will not want to just print the loop results. Instead, you may want to keep them in a separate variable. Check the following example. What's the result from the 4th iteration?</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Vector to loop through
practical.attribute.vec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;great&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;boring&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;very long&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;informative&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;here&quot;</span>)

## Empty vector to keep loop results
phrase.vec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>()

for (practical.attribute in practical.attribute.vec) {
  phrase     &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">paste</span>(<span class="st">&quot;This practical is&quot;</span>, practical.attribute, <span class="dt">collapse=</span><span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>)
  <span class="co"># Add the loop result to end of the vector of results</span>
  phrase.vec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(phrase.vec, phrase)
}</code></pre>
<p>A different way of approaching a for loop is to loop through the indexes of a vector, rather than the vector itself. In the following code, we also create a vector for the result with the same length as the vector we are looping through, and we use the index to 'populate' it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## Vector to loop through
practical.attribute.vec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;great&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;boring&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;very long&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;informative&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;here&quot;</span>)

## Empty vector to keep loop results
phrase.vec &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="ot">NA</span>, <span class="kw">length</span>(practical.attribute.vec))

## Loop through the index rather than the vector
for (i in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="kw">length</span>(practical.attribute.vec)) {

  ## Create phrase, getting attribute from practical.attribute.vec[i]
  phrase     &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">paste</span>(<span class="st">&quot;This practical is&quot;</span>, practical.attribute.vec[i], <span class="dt">collapse=</span><span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>)

  ## Add phrase to the right index of the results vector
  phrase.vec[i] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>phrase

}</code></pre>
<p>Once you are comfortable with loops, have a go at the following tasks:</p>
<h4 id="q8a.-write-a-loop-that-iterates-over-the-numbers-10-to-100-and-prints-out-the-index-of-the-loop-each-time-through.">Q8A. Write a loop that iterates over the numbers 10 to 100, and prints out the index of the loop each time through.</h4>

<h4 id="q12.-write-a-loop-that-calculates-the-product-of-all-numbers-from-1-to-10-and-then-subtracts-the-numbers-1-to-10-in-turn.-i.e.-product-1-then-product-2-followed-by-product-3-etc.">Q12. Write a loop that calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to 10, and then subtracts the numbers 1 to 10 in turn. i.e. (product)-1, then (product)-2, followed by (product)-3… etc).</h4>
<h3 id="nested-loops">Nested Loops</h3>
<p>Another important way of extending loops is to consider nested loops - in other words, loops within other loops! Have a look at the following code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">for (i in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>) {
 |<span class="st"> </span>for (j in <span class="dv">7</span>:<span class="dv">9</span>) {
 |<span class="st">  </span><span class="er">|</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">print</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(i,j))
 |<span class="st"> </span>}
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we have one loop (with index j) nested within another loop (with index i). I have also defined the values that i and j can take directly within the loops, rather than outside of the loops as in previous examples - this is simply a way of saving space. Evaluate this code and try to make sense of the output. Fiddle around with the different elements of this code until you are comfortable with nested loops. Warning - loops require your computer to perform many operations, and as such it is quite easy to crash R using loops. A simple block of code evaluated 100,000 times amounts to quite a big job. If you want to force R to exit a loop part way through, simply press Esc. Nested loops are particularly hazardous!</p>
<h4 id="q13.-create-a-nested-loop.-the-outer-loop-should-be-over-the-words-angry-lazy-and-happy.-the-inner-loop-should-be-over-the-words-birds-dogs-and-horses.-the-code-inside-the-inner-loop-should-print-out-a-vector-containing-the-indexes-of-both-loops-for-example-angry-and-birds-in-the-first-instance.">Q13.

The inner loop should be over the words &quot;birds&quot;, &quot;dogs&quot;, and &quot;horses&quot;. The code inside the inner loop should print out a vector containing the indexes of both loops (for example &quot;Angry&quot; and &quot;birds&quot; in the first instance).</h4>

<h3 id="using-loops-to-reformat-a-data-set">Using loops to reformat a data set</h3>
<p>Loops tend to be particularly useful to reformat data sets. By looping through all of the fields of a particular data set, and at each iteration dropping the relevant entry into a new data structure, it is possible to convert from one data format to another.</p>
<p>The data set that we will use in this example is typical of the sort of data that you might be faced with in the future. Load the data by running the following line of code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">helianthus.data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.matrix</span>(<span class="kw">read.table</span>(<span class="st">&quot;http://www.antgenomes.org/~yannickwurm/tmp/HelianthusData_num.txt &quot;</span>, <span class="dt">header=</span>T))</code></pre>
<p>Each row in this data set represents a different strain of <em>Helianthus annuus</em> (sunflowers), grown under controlled conditions. The first column tells us the Strain (these are numbered 1 to 5). The remaining columns describe the number of plants found in the study area at six different points in time. For example, looking at the first row, we can see that strain 1 started out with 12 plants, but by the final time point contained 57 plants.</p>
<h4 id="q15-the-aim-of-the-following-exercice-is-to-get-the-data-from-the-current-format-into-whats-generally-called-the-long-format">Q15 The aim of the following exercice is to get the data from the current format into what's generally called the 'long format'</h4>
<p>We want to get this data into a new format - sometimes called long format - in which we have a matrix of three columns; the first column describes the strain, the second column describes the time point, and the third column describes the number of plants observed. The first few lines of this new data structure should look like this:</p>
<p>|Strain | Time | Count| |-------|------|------| |1 |0 |12 | |1 |1 |33 | |1 |2 |71 | |1 |3 |61 | |1 |4 |73 | |1 |5 |57 | |2 |0 |10 | |2 |1 |27 | ...</p>
<p>We can make the transition from the wide format of helianthus.data to the long format described above using a nested loop. But first, let us create an empty matrix, which we will eventually fill with our new values.</p>
<h4 id="q15.a.-create-an-empty-matrix-called-long.data.-this-matrix-must-have-3-columns-and-30-rows-the-number-30-comes-from-the-fact-that-we-have-five-strains-at-six-time-points-each.-name-the-columns-cstrain-time-count.">Q15.a. Create an empty matrix, called <code>long.data</code>. This matrix must have 3 columns, and 30 rows (the number 30 comes from the fact that we have five strains at six time points each). Name the columns <code>c(&quot;Strain&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Count&quot;)</code>.</h4>
<p>With this empty matrix created, we can move on to the next part of the problem - populating it with values. We want to look at each of the elements of helianthus.data one after the other, using a nested loop. The basic structure of this nested loop is as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># Loop through all rows</span>
for (myrow in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>) {
    <span class="co"># Loop through all columns except the first</span>
    for (mycol in <span class="dv">2</span>:<span class="dv">7</span>) {

        <span class="co"># This is where the main code goes.</span>

    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we are using loops to index through each of the rows of the matrix <code>helianthus.data</code>, and for each row we are indexing through columns 2 to 7 (as these are the columns that contain relevant data). At any point in the two loops, the value that we are focusing on is given by <code>helianthus.data[myrow,mycol]</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can already see that these are the exact values we want to drop into the third column of our matrix <code>long.data</code>. However, we are presented with a problem - how do we drop these values one after the other into the right place in the matrix<code>long.data</code>? We cannot use the index myrow to help us, as this only goes through values <code>1:5</code>. Similarly, we cannot use the <code>index mycol</code>, as this only goes through values <code>2:7</code>. What we really need is a new index that goes all the way from 1 to 30, irrespective of the row or column that we are focusing on.</p>
<h4 id="q15.b.-change-the-for-loop-above-to-include-a-variable-myindex.-this-variable-should-be-defined-as-being-0-before-the-loop-starts.-at-every-iteration-of-the-inner-loop-you-should-add-1-to-it.">Q15.b. Change the for loop above to include a variable <code>myindex</code>. This variable should be defined as being 0 before the loop starts.

<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># myindex defined as 0 before the loop starts</span>
myindex &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">0</span>

<span class="co"># Loop through all rows</span>
for (myrow in <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>) {
    <span class="co"># Loop through all columns except the first</span>
    for (mycol in <span class="dv">2</span>:<span class="dv">7</span>) {

        ## Change myindex here:
    <span class="co"># make myindex equal to myindex plus one</span>

    <span class="co"># If you want to check what you are doing so far,</span>

}</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have three indices - one going through the rows of <code>helianthus.data</code>, one going through the columns of <code>helianthus.data</code>, and one simply going from 1 to 30 - we have all the ingredients we need to populate the matrix <code>long.data</code>. The code we need at each iteration of the loop is the following:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># Get Count</span>
long.data[myindex,<span class="dv">3</span>] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>helianthus.data[myrow,mycol]</code></pre>
<p>This is fairly straightforward. We also want to drop the time point in the second column of long.data. Although we do not have a vector describing each of the time points, in fact the timings are very simply given by mycol minus two. For example, if we are looking at the fourth column then we are looking at the second time point. Therefore, we need the following line of code to extract the timings:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># Get Time</span>
long.data[myindex,<span class="dv">2</span>] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>mycol<span class="dv">-2</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, we want to drop the strain type into the first column of long.data. The strain type is given by the first element in every row, meaning it is given by helianthus.data[myrow,1]. Therefore, we need the following line of code to extract the strain types:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># Get Strain</span>
long.data[myindex,<span class="dv">1</span>] &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>helianthus.data[myrow,<span class="dv">1</span>]</code></pre>

Write a function that converts a short DNA sequence of 15 bases (eg ACCTGTCATCATCCC) to RNA, and splits the string into triplets. You will need to:</h4>
<pre><code>     1. replace T with U  (thymine with uracil to convert DNA to RNA)
             2. use `substring()` to split the sequence into triplets, and `seq()` within `substring()`
             3. return the RNA triplets string</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>substring()</code> takes a &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot; argument. The &quot;first&quot; would be <code>seq()</code> indicating where the beginning of your first triplet is and where the beginning of your last triplet is. The &quot;last&quot; argument would be <code>seq()</code> indicating where the end of your first triplet is, and the end of your last triplet. In <code>seq()</code> you will also indicate you want triplets.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">dna.string&lt;-<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;AAATTT&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">substring</span>(dna.string, <span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dt">by=</span><span class="dv">3</span>), <span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>, <span class="dt">by=</span><span class="dv">3</span>))</code></pre>
<p>Once you have created the function, see if you can modify the function to work for a sequence with any number of characters. Tip: you can use <code>nchar()</code> to create a variable such as <code>num.characters</code>.</p>
<h4 id="q17-bonus-question.-write-a-function-to-obtain-the-reverse-complement-of-a-dna-sequence.">Q17 (Bonus question). Write a function to obtain the reverse-complement of a DNA sequence.</h4>
<p>You can use this sequence: <code>&quot;ATTACGACGCGATTCCCGGTTAATCGAATTCCCA&quot;</code>. As an example, the complement of ATGC is TACG.</p>
<p>The tricky part here is reversing a single string of characters. Search around for <code>strsplit</code>. You will need to: * replace bases with their complement * split the string of DNA bases into separate characters with <code>strsplit</code>. Note that <code>strsplit</code> returns a list, so you will need to use <code>unlist()</code> to obtain a string * reverse the sequence * remove the spaces to get your single string of DNA bases * return the reverse-complement sequence</p>

<p>Note: depending on your method, you may not need to convert it to RNA first. You can use a codon-to-amino-acid table and code the translation yourself. Alternatively, you could search around and load a specific package for the manipulation of biological sequences.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-it-together">Bringing it Together</h2>
<p>Well done for making it this far! Now try to bring all of your knowledge together. Have another look over your previous notes, and make sure these ideas are still fresh in your mind. Have a go at writing your own scripts, preferably combining a number of different concepts (for example, you could try making a function that acts on a matrix, and then using this function within a loop). Another good idea would be to come up with a problem that you want to solve (either for fun or for other coursework), and then write a function that solves it. Many of the ideas presented in this session and the last are designed to challenge you. Do not expect to understand them from a single read through the material. Rather, you will have to play around with many different examples and applications before the penny drops completely. On the plus side, structures such as loops and functions are common to almost all programming languages, and so once you understand these concepts the world of programming is your oyster!</p>
